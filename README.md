# External ImGui Overlay
A basic but easy to modify base for any external ImGui projects. Does not inject or hook functions, but does by default create handle to target program. Feel free to submit issues or pull requests. I've tried my best to keep the code relatively clean and organized, which I feel like I've done quite a decent job at. Happy coding :)

## How do I use this code?
1. Either clone the repository using Git, or download using the green button on the top right
2. Once downloaded, open the .sln file using [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) (2019 and below should work, but I use 2022)
3. Make sure build mode is set to **Release and x64**!
4. Press Ctrl + Shift + B to build the project
5. Navigate to `"C:\your\path\here\External ImGui Base\x64\Release\"`, where you will find the executable
